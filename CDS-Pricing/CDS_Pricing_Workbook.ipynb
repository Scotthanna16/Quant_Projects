    "## What is a Credit Default Swap?\n",
    "#### A CDS is a financial derivative that acts as insurance on a corporate bong.  The purchaser (often called the protection buyer) of the CDS pays premiums (referred to as the CDS Spread), usually on a quarterly basis. In return, if the reference company defaults or fails to make a bond payment, the seller (often reffered to as the protection seller) compensates the purchaser. "

    "## How are Credit Default Swaps used?\n",
    "#### As stated above, the primary purpose of CDSs is as insurance against a company going bankrupt. In the same way one might hedge against the fall of a stock's price, or an increase in a commodity's price, the protection buyer is hedging against the default of the company. So far we have talked about how CDSs can be used to protect against the default of a company. However, a party can buy protection against many different bonds. For instance, in the same way a buyer can buy protection against the default of a company, someone can purchase protection against the bankruptcy of a government. Another famous example is that of Michael Burry. Burry bought CDSs referencing sub-prime Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), correctly predicting the implosion of the housing market in 2008. "

    "## Layers of Risk\n",
    "#### One interesting caveat of CDSs is that the event that they are supposed to protect against, bankruptcy, can also be in issue for the protection seller. What if the seller of the CDS goes bankrupt? \n",
    "#### This is what happened to American International Group (AIG) in 2008. AIG had sold so many CDSs that there was concern they would go bankrupt and not be able to pay the protection buyers. The question became, if AIG was not able to pay the purchasers of the CDSs, how many of those purchasers would also go bankrupt? Not wanting to find out the answer to that question, the US government bailed out AIG."

    "### Setup\n",
    "#### The following is the necessary setup, we import the necessary libraries and read the data. I assume most of this is rather standard, I will focus a little bit on interp1d. Interp1d is used to interpolate data, our dummy data is broken up by year but payments are made quarterly. So, we interpolate the quarterly information. In reality, this is far from perfect, but for the purposes of this notebook it is fine. The maturities are kept in a seperate list so we can iterate over them later, as CDSs with different maturities have different values...duh.\n",
    "#### The second part defines some constants. The recovery rate represents the amount an unprotected bond holder can expect to recoup if the reference entity defaults. 40% is fairly standard, but usually recovery rates change with the seniority of the bond. The notional value is the amount of money on which the protection is written. In the equation below it will be omitted for sake of normalizing the equations, but one simply multiplies the Notional value. Finally, dt represents how often we make payments. Usually they are quarterly payments, hence dt = .25.\n",
    "#### Finally, the function defined at the bottom produces the survival probability, i.e. the probability the reference entity does not default before a given time. "
